# Public API

## Geometric setting

The original public API statements are about complex manifolds of dimension `n`, given unbundled:

```lean
{X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] [ChartedSpace (ComplexModel n) X] [IsComplexManifold n X]
```

where `ComplexModel n = EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin n)` and `IsComplexManifold n X` asks for a Hausdorff, second countable topological space with a holomorphic atlas (Mathlib's `IsManifold 𝓘(ℂ, ℂⁿ) ∞`). Everything is complex-analytic. The original global finite-sequence existence theorems assume **compactness**: either `X` is compact, or the relevant set (`Z(𝔞)`, `V`, `W`) is compact; otherwise the results hold over open sets contained in a compact set, or over a **relatively compact** neighbourhood of any compact set.

Vocabulary (all in this library): `GermIdeal n X` is an ideal sheaf of holomorphic germs, with `IsCoherent`, `zeroLocus` (`Z(𝔞)`), `pullback`; `EffectiveDivisor` is an invertible ideal sheaf `𝒪(-D)` with its support; `ClosedIrreducibleAnalyticSubvariety` and `IsComplexAnalyticSubset` are analytic subsets; `Hironaka.singularLocus V = V \ V_reg` (`V_sing`), and `W_sing = W \ regularLocus W d`; `IsSNCDivisor n E` says that the closed members of the list `E` have simple normal crossings (at every point the members through it are distinct coordinate hyperplanes of one chart); an *admissible blowup sequence* of `(X, E₀)` over `F` (`HironakaAdmissibleSequence.IsAdmissibleBlowupSequence n X E₀ F X' f E`) is a finite composition `f : X' → X` of blowups with smooth centres, each centre having only normal crossings with the divisor accumulated so far and lying over `F`; `E` starts with the strict transforms of the members of `E₀`, then has one member per blowup. `exceptionalLocus` (`Exc f`), `strictTransform` and `IsIsomorphismOver` have their usual meaning.

## What is proved

The original API surface consists of the 42 theorems of the modules `Hironaka.API`, `Hironaka.API2`, `Hironaka.API3`, `Hironaka.API4`. They are restatements, with the internal machinery hidden, of the theorems of the `Hironaka.Resolution.*` modules. All of them are stated in the namespace `Hironaka`.

The principalization hypothesis "`𝔞` is nonzero at every point" is written out as `∀ x, ∃ g, 𝔞.mem x g ∧ ∃ᶠ y in 𝓝 x, g y ≠ 0` (at every point some germ of `𝔞` does not vanish identically near the point).
