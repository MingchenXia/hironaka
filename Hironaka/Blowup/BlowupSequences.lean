# Blowups with smooth centers, modifications and strict transforms

New definitions of this first pass:

* `IsClosedSubmanifold C`: `C` is closed and locally biholomorphically a
  coordinate plane at each of its points (a smooth center; components may have
  different dimensions).  `IsClosedConnectedSubmanifold W k` fixes the dimension
  and adds connectedness.
* `exceptionalLocus f`: the points where the holomorphic differential of
  `f : Y → X` (equal dimensions) is not bijective.  For a proper bimeromorphic map
  of complex manifolds this is the smallest set off which `f` is biholomorphic
  onto its image (Zariski's main theorem makes the fibre through a point of
  invertible differential a single point).
* `strictTransform f A = closure (f⁻¹ A \ Exc f)`.
* `IsIsomorphismOver f S`: `f` maps `f⁻¹ S` bijectively onto `S` and is a local
  biholomorphism at each point of `f⁻¹ S`.
* `IsBlowupAlong C π`: `π` is the blowup of `X` along the nowhere dense closed
  submanifold `C`, defined by its universal property: `π` is holomorphic, `𝓘_C 𝒪_Y` is invertible,
  and every holomorphic `g : Z → X` from a complex manifold with `𝓘_C 𝒪_Z`
  invertible factors uniquely and holomorphically through `π`.  Test manifolds
  range over all dimensions in the universe of `Y`; since the blowup of a
  manifold along a smooth center is a manifold, this characterizes it up to
  unique isomorphism.  The center is required to be nowhere dense: the universal
  property alone would also accept the blowup along a whole connected component,
  which deletes that component (a map into it pulls `𝓘_C` back to the zero
  ideal, which is never invertible), and such a map is not a modification.
* `IsBlowupSequence n X Y f`: `f` is a finite composition of blowups with smooth
  centers (a modification in the manuscript's sense).
