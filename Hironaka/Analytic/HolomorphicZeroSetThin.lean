# Zero sets of holomorphic functions are thin; the germ ring is a domain

Let `U` be a preconnected open subset of a complex normed space `E` and `h : E → ℂ` complex
differentiable on `U`, not vanishing identically near some point of `U`.

* `eqOn_zero_of_eventually_eq_zero`: the identity theorem: if `h` vanishes near one point
  of `U`, then it vanishes on `U`. The set of points near which `h` vanishes is open; it is
  closed in `U` by the one-variable identity theorem along complex lines.
* `dense_compl_zeroSet`: `U ⊆ closure (U \ h ⁻¹' {0})`.
* `isDomain_holGerm`: the ring `HolGerm E` of holomorphic germs at `0` is a domain.
