# A nonzero holomorphic germ is regular in a suitable direction

Let `g` be complex differentiable near `0` in a complex normed space `E` and not identically
zero near `0`, and let `e ≠ 0`.  After a continuous linear change of coordinates `A` the
restriction `t ↦ g (A (t • e))` has finite order `d` at `0`:
`g (A (t • e)) = t ^ d * u t` with `u` analytic and `u 0 ≠ 0`.  This is the normalization
before Weierstrass division in the proof that holomorphic germs form a Noetherian ring.

The proof.  Pick `w ≠ 0` so small that `g` is differentiable on the ball of radius `2‖w‖`
and `g w ≠ 0`.  Then `φ t = g (t • w)` is holomorphic on the disc of radius `2`, and
`φ 1 ≠ 0`, so by the identity theorem `φ` does not vanish near `0` and has a finite order
there.  Continuous linear equivalences act transitively on nonzero vectors, so some `A`
sends `e` to `w`.
