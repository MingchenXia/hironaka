# Uniqueness of Weierstrass division

Source: Gunning--Rossi, *Analytic functions of several complex variables*, II.B,
Theorem 1 (uniqueness part); Chirka, *Complex analytic sets*, §1.1.  Needed for the
factorial property of the rings of holomorphic germs and for local parametrization.

* `eq_zero_of_eval_eq_mul_eval`: if a polynomial `R` of degree `< deg W`, `W` monic, agrees
  with `h · W` on an open set containing every root of `W`, with `h` continuous there, then
  `R = 0`.  Induction on `deg W`, dividing out one root at a time; at the root itself the
  identity is recovered by continuity.
* `weierstrass_division_unique`: if `q W + ∑_{k<d} r_k(z) t^k = 0` near `0`, for a
  Weierstrass polynomial `W = t^d + ∑_{k<d} a_k(z) t^k`, then all `r_k` and `q` vanish near
  `0`.  For small `z` the roots of `W(z, ·)` lie in a small disc, so the remainder vanishes
  as a polynomial; then `q(z, ·) = 0` off the finitely many roots, hence everywhere.
