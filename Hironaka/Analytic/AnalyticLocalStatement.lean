# The local statement (LS) for analytic subsets

Near every point `p` of an analytic subset `A` of a complex manifold there are an open
neighbourhood `W` of `p` inside the preferred chart at `p` and finitely many subsets
`A₁, …, A_r` of `W` with `A ∩ W = ⋃ Aᵢ` such that

* each `Aᵢ` is the common zero set in `W` of finitely many functions holomorphic on the
  chart image of `W`;
* EVERY regular point of `Aᵢ` has dimension `dᵢ`, and the regular points of `Aᵢ` of
  dimension `dᵢ` are dense in `Aᵢ`;
* for `i ≠ l`, `Aᵢ ∩ A_l` has empty interior relative to `Aᵢ`.

The `Aᵢ` are representatives of the irreducible components of the germ of `A` at `p`; the statement is the output of
the local parametrization theorem for irreducible germs.

`LocalDecomposition A p` bundles these data.  Their existence,
`exists_localDecomposition`, is assembled in `Hironaka.LocalStatementAssembly`; the global
consequences (analyticity of the dimension strata and pure dimensionality of irreducible
analytic sets) are derived from it in `Hironaka.PureDimension`.
