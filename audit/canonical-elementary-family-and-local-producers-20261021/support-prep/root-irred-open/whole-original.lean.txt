# Irreducible components of analytic subsets

Source: the analytic-geometry facts used in Copy-4, `sec:gluing`
(`transcendental-nakamaye-copy4-20260911`): "a connected complex manifold is
irreducible", and "if `E_nK(α)` has no isolated points, each of its irreducible
components is positive-dimensional"; blueprint `ana:irreducible-components`.
These are standard (Grauert--Remmert, *Coherent analytic sheaves*, Ch. 9;
Demailly, *Complex analytic and differential geometry*, II.5).

* `isComplexAnalyticallyIrreducible_univ`: a nonempty connected complex manifold
  is analytically irreducible (identity theorem: a proper analytic subset of a
  connected manifold is nowhere dense).  Proved in
  `FirstPass.AnalyticSubsetTopology`.
* `regularAtDim_univ`, `exists_subvariety_univ`: the manifold itself is a closed
  irreducible analytic subvariety of dimension `n`.
* `eq_univ_of_isClosedConnectedSubmanifold_self`: a closed connected submanifold of
  full dimension of a connected manifold is the whole manifold.
* `exists_isIrreducibleComponent_pos_dim_of_accPt`: every non-isolated point of an
  analytic subset lies on a positive-dimensional irreducible component.  (The
  global irreducible components form a locally finite family of maximal
  irreducible analytic subsets; the germ at a non-isolated point has positive
  dimension, so some component through it does, and irreducible analytic sets are
  pure-dimensional.)  Derived in `Pending.PositiveDimensionalComponent` (blueprint
  `ana:irreducible-components`) from (LS) with connected regular parts and the closures of
  the connected components of the regular locus.
* `eq_dim_of_regularAtDim`: an irreducible analytic subvariety is pure-dimensional,
  i.e. every regular point has the certified dimension (Chirka, §5.3--5.4).  Derived in
  `Pending.PureDimension` from the local statement (LS)
  `AnalyticLocalStatement.exists_localDecomposition`, itself proved from the local
  parametrization theorem (`GermParametrization.exists_localParametrization`).
* `exists_mem_regularLocus_not_mem_of_not_subset`: an irreducible analytic
  subvariety not contained in an analytic subset `A` has a point, regular of the
  certified dimension, outside `A`.  PROVED from pure dimensionality and density of
  the regular locus (`FirstPass.RegularLocusDense.exists_regularAtDim_mem_nhds`,
  sorry-free): `V \ A` is a nonempty relatively open subset of `V`.  Used for
  positivity of restricted volumes.

A regular point of `univ` of dimension `k` carries a biholomorphic flattening
`Φ` whose target is an open set containing `0` and contained in the coordinate
plane `{z : ∀ i ≥ k, z i = 0}`: every `w ∈ Φ.target` is `Φ.toFun (Φ.invFun w)`
with `Φ.invFun w ∈ Φ.source`, and the flattening equation applies to every point
of the source because every point of the manifold lies in `univ`.  A nonempty
open subset of `ℂ^n` inside that plane forces `k = n`, since otherwise a small
multiple of the `k`-th basis vector would lie in it with nonzero `k`-th
coordinate. -/

/-- **Irreducible analytic sets are pure-dimensional.**
At every point where an irreducible analytic subvariety `V` is regular, its dimension is
the certified dimension `dim V`.

Classically the regular locus of an irreducible analytic set is a connected manifold
(Chirka, *Complex Analytic Sets*, §5.3--5.4; Grauert--Remmert, *Coherent analytic
sheaves*, Ch. 9, §1--2); equivalently, the closures of the dimension strata of the regular
locus are analytic and irreducibility selects one of them.  This replaces (run 0031 r3)
the former input `exists_mem_regularLocus_not_mem_of_not_subset`, whose density half is
proved in `FirstPass.RegularLocusDense`.  Derived in `Pending.PureDimension` (blueprint
`ana:pure-dimension`) from the local statement (LS),
`AnalyticLocalStatement.exists_localDecomposition`. -/

/-- **Top-dimensional regular points off a proper analytic subset.**
An irreducible analytic subvariety `V` not contained in an analytic subset `A` has a point
outside `A` at which `V` is regular of dimension `dim V`.

`A` is closed, so `V \ A` is a nonempty relatively open subset of `V`; the regular locus is
dense (`RegularLocusDense.exists_regularAtDim_mem_nhds`, sorry-free), so `V` is regular of
some dimension at a point of `Aᶜ`, and that dimension is `dim V` by pure dimensionality
(`eq_dim_of_regularAtDim`). -/
